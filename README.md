This is a project to demonstrate HTML skills acquired thus far following along The Odin Project.
The assignment was to create a simple recipe website.

What I've learned:

- Structuring HTML code
- Structure of a web page/website
- File and directory organisation
- Setting up and usage of Git/GitHub
- Usage of links (Absolute/Relative)
- Creating and organizing lists (Ordered/Unordered)
- Usage and importance of semantic elements (em/strong)
- Usage of images
